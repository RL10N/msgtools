# CHANGES TO msgtools 0.2.2

* Streamlined the `install_translations()` function and separated `check_translation()` and `check_translations()` into separate functions.
* Added `sync_template()` function to update an existing template (or create a new template file if doesn't exist). This is now called internally by `use_localization()`.
* Added `check_for_gettext()` function to confirm availability of gettext.
* Added `get_message_distances()` function to compare message string edit distance (useful for duplicate checking).
* `make_translation()` now updates an existing translation against the template file before reading into memory.
* Updated README documentation.
* Fixed numerous `R CMD check` warnings and notes.

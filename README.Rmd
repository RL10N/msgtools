# Tools for Developing Diagnostic Messages

**msgtools** implements a number utilities for developing and maintaining error, warning, and other messages in R packages, including checking for consistency across messages, spell-checking messages, and building message translations into various languages for purposes of localization. The package is designed to enhance **devtools**.

## Building and updating message translation files

The package creates a simplified workflow for creating, maintaining, and updating translations of messages in both R and C code that improve upon those available in the **tools** package. For some context on message localization in R, see ["R Administration"](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html#Localization-of-messages) and ["Translating R Messages, R >=3.0.0"](http://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html)). A list of "translation teams" is available from http://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html.

R has reasonably sophisticated built-in *internationalization* (i18n) features. All calls to `message()`, `warning()`, `stop()`, `gettext()`, `ngettext()`, and `gettextf()` are passed through a C-level functionality that translates the contained messages into the user's local language (if the translations are available).

To begin *localization* (l10n) of messages, a package developer simply needs to (1) write translations for these messages using a standardized file format and (2) install the translations into their package. Localization traditionally requires the manual creation of a `.pot` ("portable object template") file using the `xgettext` command line utility and the generation of language-specific .po ("portable object") translation files that specify the translation of each message string into the target language.

The .pot/.po file format is fairly straight forward, simply containing a series of messages and their translations, plus some metadata:

```
#: lib/error.c:116
msgid "Unknown system error"
msgstr "Error desconegut del sistema"
```

(The R source contains a number of examples of translations, for example in [the base pacakge](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/po/).)

**msgtools** negates the need to directly call the command-line utilities or interact with .pot/.po files by relying on R representations of templates and translations (provided by [poio](https://cran.r-project.org/package=poio)). This makes it possible to programmatically create, modify, and install translations, thus eliminating the need to manually open each translation file in a text editor.

A basic **msgtools** workflow is as follows:

```{r}
library("msgtools")

# setup package for localization
use_localization()

# create Spanish translation
es <- make_translation("es", translator = "Some Translator <translator@example.com")
write_translation(es)

## edit translations manually!

# reload translations (if you want)
es <- make_translation("es")

# check translation files for errors
check_translations()

# install translations
install_translations()
```

At this point, you still have to manually edit the the .po translation files created by `make_translation()` using either a text editor or the lightweight `edit_translation()` function.

### Interactive message translation

Currently, msgtools provides a very basic interactive interface for creating message translations, which can then be written to file:

```R
# interactively update or create Spanish translation
es <- edit_translation(es)
write_translation(es)
```

This negates the need to manually open and edit translation (.po) files in a text editor. If translations files are edited, `make_translation()` will read those revisions into memory rather than generating a new (empty) translation file from the template.

## Other functionality

The R representations of messsages allow some additional functionality for working with diagnostic messages, which may be useful to package developers.

### Checking consistency of diagnostic messages

Packages frequently use similar errors and warnings across functions, but in practice these errors and warnings might have slight changes in wording, spelling, etc. that can be confusing to users. The `get_messages()` function extracts all messages as a tidy data frame, which can be used to examine possible problems or near-duplications of messages strings:

```{r}
head(sort(get_messages()[["msgid"]]))
```

The `get_message_distance()` can further be used to identify these situations.

```{r}
get_message_distances()
```

The resulting data frame contains columns corresponding to the Levenshtein (edit) distance between each message and every other message.

### Spell checking

Unavoidably, packages have spelling errors. The `spell_check_msgs()` function checks messages for spelling errors and returns a data frame of suggestion corrections for those errors.

```{r}
spell_check_msgs()
```

## Requirements and Installation

[![CRAN Version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/msgtools)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=msgtools)
![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/msgtools)
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RL10N/msgtools.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RL10N/msgtools)
[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/RL10N/msgtools/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/RL10N/msgtools?branch=master)

The development version can be installed directly from GitHub using `ghit`:

```R
if (!require('ghit')) {
    install.packages('ghit')
    library('ghit')
}
install_github('RL10N/msgtools')
```

**msgtools** will eventually be available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=msgtools), so that it can be installed using:

```R
install.packages('msgtools')
```

Note that **msgtools** also has one system requirement (i.e., software that must be installed separately from R). Specifically, the package requires [GNU gettext-tools](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). Windows binaries can be installed from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/gettext-tools.zip or https://github.com/mlocati/gettext-iconv-windows.
